# Course-TimeTabling-GA
This Project aims to solve a Course Scheduling Problem, using genetic algorithms.

## Project Overview:
In this project, we present a good method for creating Course Time Tables for our university,
which normally consumes a lot of effort in terms of time and money.
We have used Genetic Algorithm, we built a core model, which satisfies several constraints and conditions.

## Prerequisites:
* Project Environment: MATLAB.
* Genetic Algorithm Toolbox. (MathWorks)
 
## Authors:
* Majd Akleh
* Marsil Zakour
* Qais Badour
